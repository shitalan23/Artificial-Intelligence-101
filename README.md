# Artificial-Intelligence-101

This project explores machine translation evaluation, image-to-image translation, deep learning models, and NLP pipelines. It includes a critical analysis of research papers on BLEU score and CycleGAN, alongside hands-on implementation of CNNs, autoencoders, Bayesian regression, transformers, and retrieval-augmented generation.
